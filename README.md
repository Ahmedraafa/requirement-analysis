## What is Requirement Analysis?  
Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, understanding, and documenting the needs of stakeholders to define the objectives and scope of a software project. It bridges the gap between user expectations and technical solutions, ensuring clarity and feasibility.  

---

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  
- **Ensures Project Clarity:** Defines clear objectives and scope, reducing ambiguities.  
- **Prevents Scope Creep:** Helps maintain focus by managing stakeholder expectations.  
- **Enhances Project Success:** Aligns development efforts with business goals, reducing rework and delays.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  
- **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting stakeholder needs through interviews, surveys, and workshops.  
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Refining gathered data using techniques like brainstorming and prototyping.  
- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating detailed documents like specifications and use cases.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Structuring requirements with diagrams and models for clarity.  
- **Requirement Validation:** Ensuring requirements align with stakeholder expectations.

## Types of Requirements  

### Functional Requirements  
Functional requirements specify what the system should do. Examples for the booking system include:  
- User Registration  
- Booking a property  
- Payment processing  

### Non-functional Requirements  
Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system. Examples include:  
- **Performance:** Page load time under 2 seconds  
- **Security:** Data encryption for user information

## Use Case Diagrams  
Use Case Diagrams visualize system interactions between actors (users) and functionalities, promoting clarity and communication.

## Acceptance Criteria  
Acceptance Criteria define measurable conditions a feature must satisfy to be accepted. They ensure alignment with business and user needs.  

**Example for the Checkout feature:**  
- The system must calculate the total cost, including taxes and discounts.  
- Users should be able to apply valid coupon codes.  
- The system must provide a payment confirmation page after a successful transaction.
